# Roadmap and Working Checklist

## Phase plan

### Phase 1: Live API audit (complete — Python)

Audit a UniFi deployment using the Network Integration API (X-API-KEY). Read-only. Produces sanitized markdown report + structured JSON.

**Deliverable:** `src/unifi_audit.py` + `src/findings_enhanced.py` + `src/normalize.py` + `src/models.py`

**Status: complete** — 10 finding modules wired, float-to-top sorting, profile-aware severity overrides, 58 tests passing. Validation against a real UniFi controller still outstanding.

### Phase 2: Intent-interview wizard

Web/CLI wizard that consumes the Phase 1 JSON and asks only the gap questions (intent, non-UniFi devices, process). Merges API-detected facts with user-stated intent into a complete report.

**Phase 2a: TypeScript audit core (complete)**

Full TypeScript port of the Python audit core. Framework-agnostic; will be imported by the Tauri app in Phase 2b.

**Deliverable:** `src/audit/` — types, constants, sanitize, normalize, client, 11 finding modules, analyze pipeline, collectAll, report renderer, CLI entry point (`src/cli.ts`).

**Status: complete** — 55 tests passing, `tsc --noEmit` clean. Run with `npm run build && node dist/cli.js` after setting `UNIFI_API_KEY` + `UNIFI_HOST`.

**Phase 2b: Tauri desktop app + wizard (complete)**

Tauri v2 + Svelte 5 desktop app wrapping the TypeScript audit core. SQLite persistence, profile inference + confirmation, skills-check tier routing, gap question wizard, "not sure" resolution paths, final report screen.

**Deliverable:** `src-tauri/` (Rust shell), `src/db/`, `src/wizard/`, `src/lib/`, `src/routes/` (4 screens).

**Status: complete** — all screens built, 73 tests passing, Rust compiles clean. Run with `npx tauri dev`.

### Phase 3: Site Manager API + Cloud Connector (complete — TypeScript)

For users behind CGNAT or with multi-site MSP needs. Cloud Connector proxies Network Integration API requests through `api.ui.com`, giving the same audit depth as local mode without needing a direct network path.

**Deliverable:** `src/audit/collect.ts` — `buildConnectorUrl()` helper + cloud branch enumerates consoles → sites → all 9 per-site resources via Cloud Connector. Requires a Site Manager API key (from `unifi.ui.com → API Keys`) and Cloud Connector enabled on the console (`UniFi OS → System → Cloud Access`).

**Status: complete (TypeScript)** — validated against real controller in local mode; cloud connector path implemented and ready for testing with a Site Manager key. Python (`src/unifi_audit.py`) cloud mode remains scaffolded only.

### Phase 4: Backup-file mode (complete — TypeScript)

Parse `.unf` backups entirely offline to unlock all findings that the live API v1 cannot yet expose (WLANs, VPN, firewall rules, settings-based findings).

**Deliverable:** `src/audit/normalizeBackup.ts` (normalizeBackup + parseBackupNodejs), `src/routes/backup/+page.svelte` (Backup tab UI), `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (`parse_backup` Rust command), `--backup` CLI flag. Python `src/parser.py` skeleton preserved for reference.

**Status: complete (TypeScript)** — 114 tests passing. New Backup tab in app (Analyze | Backup | Report | History). Requires Tauri restart after install.

**Phase 4.1: UniFi OS console `.unifi` backup decryption (complete — TypeScript CLI)**

Decrypt and parse the newer console-level `.unifi` System Backup format (Cloud Gateway Fiber and other UniFi OS consoles), previously undocumented. AES-256-CBC with an embedded per-file IV → gzip'd TAR → marker-based BSON stream in `backup/network/db.gz`. Reverse-engineered live against a real backup file and implemented as a fallback alongside the classic `.unf` path (which is unchanged).

**Deliverable:** `src/audit/parseUnifiOsConsoleBackup.ts` (decrypt / TAR-extract / marker-stream BSON parse), fallback chain in `src/audit/normalizeBackup.ts`'s `parseBackupNodejs`, `tools/anonymize-backup.ts` (maintainer tool: field-level-projection anonymizer), `samples/fixture-cgf-backup.json` (anonymized real-data fixture), end-to-end regression + safety tests.

**Status: complete (Node CLI + Rust/Tauri desktop)** — 183 JS tests + 9 Rust tests passing. The console format is now parsed by both the Node CLI (`parseUnifiOsConsoleBackup.ts`) and the desktop app's Rust `parse_backup` command (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`); the Backup tab accepts console backups directly. UCore PostgreSQL data still deferred (no consumer yet). See `docs/04-backup-file-strategy.md`.

**Phase 4.2: Known-advisory (CVE) tracking (complete — TypeScript)**

Flag devices running firmware with known published security advisories (e.g. the actively-exploited UniFi OS RCE chain), satisfying the "firmware behind with known advisories" always-float-to-top criterion. Also fixed `SEG-MGMT-WAN` (management-plane-reachable-from-WAN) detection.

**Deliverable:** `findKnownAdvisories` finding module + advisory data, `tools/fetch-advisories.ts` (maintainer script sourcing live NVD data), wired into `analyze()`.

**Status: complete** — merged via PR #4.

**Phase 4.3: Advisory data freshness (complete — TypeScript)**

Keep the hand-maintained advisory data from silently going stale: a weekly scheduled drift-check (`tools/check-advisory-drift.ts` + `.github/workflows/advisory-drift.yml`) compares the Ubiquiti CISA-KEV set against `knownAdvisoriesData.ts` and opens/auto-closes a tracking GitHub issue when a new KEV CVE isn't covered; a `ADVISORIES_LAST_REVIEWED` date is surfaced in the report; and `docs/09-advisory-data-maintenance.md` documents the refresh runbook.

**Status: complete.**

**Phase 4.4: API currency & drift resilience (A+B complete — TypeScript)**

Keep the app resilient to UniFi API/schema changes. (A) Runtime version self-check: reads `/v1/info`, compares the controller's Network version to a tested range (`apiVersion.ts`, `TESTED_MIN`/`TESTED_MAX`), and surfaces it as an `API-VERSION` meta-finding. (B) Maintainer schema-drift CI: `tools/check-api-drift.ts` + `.github/workflows/api-drift.yml` weekly-diff the app's endpoint set against the latest published UniFi Network OpenAPI and open/auto-close a tracking issue on drift. (C — deferred) update the stale v9-era endpoint paths (`wlans`→`wifi/broadcasts`, `firewall-policies`→`firewall/policies`, etc.) to their v10 names in `collect.ts`; mapped in the design spec but pending validation against a live v10 controller. Research + design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-03-api-currency-design.md`.

**Status: A + B complete; C tracked (the drift check flags the 6 stale endpoints until C lands).**

### Phase 5: MCP integration (optional add-on)

Skills/prompts that teach Claude how to use `sirkirby/unifi-mcp` tools to remediate our findings. We do NOT build our own MCP server.

**Deliverable:** MCP skill files mapping each finding ID to upstream MCP tool calls.

**Status: not started**

### Phase 6: Apply mode

Generate UniFi config changes that can be reviewed as a diff and applied via the API. Preview-then-confirm per change. Uses official write endpoints as they stabilize.

**Deliverable:** Apply mode in `unifi_audit.py` with explicit `--apply` flag.

**Status: not started, awaiting API write GA**

### Phase 7: Drift monitoring (complete — History tab)

Visualise security posture over time and compare any two runs to see what changed.

**Deliverable:** `src/audit/diff.ts` (diff engine), `src/routes/history/+page.svelte` (SVG line chart + diff panel), persistent tab bar (Analyze / Report / History) via `src/routes/+layout.svelte`.

**Status: complete** — 101 tests passing. Run `npx tauri dev` and open the History tab. Scheduling and alerting remain out of scope; manual re-auditing with visual comparison covers the core use case.

#### Validation against real network (outstanding)

- [x] Run TypeScript CLI against real UniFi controller (local + cloud modes validated Apr 2026; unifi_audit.py not yet tested)
- [ ] Diff actual API response shapes against assumed shapes
- [ ] Test with Network version >= 9.3.43 (required for integration API)

## Known gaps (deferred, not forgotten)

These are explicitly out of scope for Phase 1 but tracked here so they don't get lost.

- **MFA on cloud admin account.** Not in any API or backup. Must be a gap question for the wizard (Phase 2).
- **CyberSecure subscription state.** Lives in cloud, not exposed via current local API.
- **Real-time traffic patterns.** Not in backup; live API has limited visibility.
- ~~**CVE database for known-vulnerable firmware.**~~ **Done (Phase 4.2)** — `findKnownAdvisories` module + `tools/fetch-advisories.ts` (sources live NVD data).
- **Protect/Access app audits.** Out of scope for Phase 1; Network only.
- **Multi-site MSP workflows.** Phase 3 territory.
- ~~**`.unifi` console-format decryption.**~~ **Done (Phase 4.1)** — AES-256-CBC + embedded IV + TAR + marker-based BSON, implemented in both the TypeScript CLI and the Rust/Tauri desktop app.
